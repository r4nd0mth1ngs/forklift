/// Handle the cherry-pick command (§9.1 #8): apply a parcel's diff onto the current pallet
/// as a new, author-preserving, freshly-signed parcel.
///
/// The source parcel's change — its diff against its first parent — is three-way merged
/// onto the current head (the same machinery `consolidate` uses). A clean pick is stacked
/// immediately as a single-parent parcel that preserves the source's authors and records
/// this operator as the stacker; a conflicting pick leaves markers and a cherry-pick state,
/// and the next `stack` completes it. Cherry-pick only *adds* — no rewrite, no force-push.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `revision` - The parcel to cherry-pick (a pallet name, or a parcel hash / prefix).
/// * `message`  - An optional message for the new parcel (default: the source's message).
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())`      - If the pick applied, or left conflicts to resolve.
/// * `Err(String)` - If there is nothing to pick, the warehouse is dirty, or an operation
///                   failed.
