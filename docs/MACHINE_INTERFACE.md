# The machine-first interface

Forklift's command surface is built to be driven by programs — scripts, CI, and AI
coding agents — as well as people. Three things make that work:
a `--json` mode with a versioned envelope, a stable error and exit-code taxonomy, and
an MCP server that exposes every command as a schema-typed tool.

## `--json`

`--json` is a global flag: add it to any command and stdout becomes exactly **one**
JSON document (nothing else prints there). Human prose is unchanged without the flag.

Success envelope:

```json
{
  "forklift_json": "2",
  "command": "stocktake",
  "ok": true,
  "data": { "…command-specific…" }
}
```

Failure envelope (also sets the exit code below):

```json
{
  "forklift_json": "2",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "not_a_warehouse",
    "message": "…",
    "next_step": "Run \"forklift prepare\" to create a warehouse here, or change into one."
  }
}
```

`forklift_json` is the output schema version. It changes only when the envelope or a
command's `data` shape changes incompatibly, so a consumer can pin it — and it *is* the
capability-detection mechanism: check the version before relying on a field, rather than
sniffing for the field's presence. A command's `data` shape is documented by the struct
it emits (in `crates/forklift/src/commands/`).

**Version 2** (current): `history` entries carry `parents` (every parcel's parents, in
stored order, always present — `[]` for a root); the `empty_history` error code exists
(`history` on an unborn pallet); `palletize` list entries carry `head`; the `show`
command reads a file's content at a revision in one call; `diff` accepts the reserved
`:empty` token (either revision) for the empty tree; and `peek` on a binary blob reports
`binary: true` instead of silently mangling the bytes.

### `history --json`

```json
{
  "data": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "parcel": "<hash>",
        "parents": ["<base-hash>", "<other-hash>"],
        "consolidates": ["<base-hash>", "<other-hash>"],
        "actions": [
          { "action": "author", "operator": "<id>", "timestamp": "2026-07-13T00:00:00+00:00" },
          { "action": "stack", "operator": "<id>", "timestamp": "2026-07-13T00:00:01+00:00" }
        ],
        "description": "…"
      },
      { "parcel": "<root-hash>", "parents": [], "actions": [ /* … */ ] }
    ],
    "next": null
  }
}
```

`parents` is always present, in the parcel's stored (canonical, base-first) order — a
root parcel's is `[]`. It is the general graph edge (every parcel, not only merges); the
older `consolidates` field is unchanged and kept for compatibility (present, non-empty,
only on a merge parcel).

`history` on an unborn pallet (nothing stacked yet) fails with `empty_history` (exit 19)
rather than the generic `error` code.

### `palletize --json` (listing)

```json
{
  "data": {
    "current": "main",
    "current_unborn": false,
    "pallets": [
      { "name": "feature/x", "current": true, "head": "<hash>" },
      { "name": "main", "current": false, "head": "<hash>" }
    ],
    "meta": []
  }
}
```

Every pallet in `pallets` carries its `head` parcel hash, `null` for an unborn one (the
current pallet is included in `pallets` even when unborn, rather than only signaled
through `current_unborn`).

Token-cheap by default: `stocktake --summary` reports counts only (no per-path lists),
and `diff --json` reports the changed-file set (path + kind) rather than every line —
a program reads specific content by hash when it needs it. `diff` also accepts the
reserved token `:empty` as either revision, meaning the empty tree — the base for
comparing a root parcel (which has no real "before") against a clean slate, so every
file it introduces lists as `Added`. `:empty` can never collide with a real revision:
a pallet/meta-pallet name is restricted to ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-` and
`/`, and a hash prefix is hex digits only — neither grammar can contain `:`.

### `show --json`

`show <revision>:<path>` reads a file's content at a revision in one call — a
program's alternative to resolving a revision, walking its tree and peeking the blob
by hash itself. The argument splits on the *first* `:` (a revision can never contain
one, so the split is unambiguous even when the path does). Its `data`:

```json
{
  "revision": "<the resolved parcel hash>",
  "path": "src/app.rs",
  "hash": "<the tree entry's own object hash: a blob hash, or a recipe hash>",
  "binary": false,
  "content": "…file text…",
  "size": 1234
}
```

`binary: true` means `content` is absent — either the bytes are not text (a NUL byte
anywhere, or the bytes are not valid UTF-8 — both count, and either alone is enough),
or the path is a chunked large file, reported by its recipe metadata instead of being
assembled:

```json
{
  "revision": "<parcel hash>",
  "path": "big.bin",
  "hash": "<recipe hash>",
  "binary": true,
  "size": 104857600,
  "content_hash": "<the assembled file's whole-content hash>",
  "chunk_count": 13
}
```

`peek <hash>` on a blob carries the same `binary` signal, with the same definition —
a NUL byte anywhere, or bytes that are not valid UTF-8, either one enough on its own:
`"binary": true` and `content` is omitted, instead of the pre-fix behavior of silently
mangling the raw bytes through a lossy UTF-8 conversion with no signal that it
had happened.

## Error codes and exit codes

Every failure carries a stable `code` an agent can branch on, and the process exits
with a deterministic status so a script can branch without parsing prose. `2`
is reserved for argument/usage errors (clap); `0` is success.

| `code`                    | exit | Meaning                                                          |
|---------------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `error`                   | 1    | Anything without a more specific classification yet               |
| `not_a_warehouse`         | 3    | The command needs a warehouse; this directory is none             |
| `conflict`                | 4    | Working state blocks the operation (unresolved / dirty)           |
| `diverged`                | 5    | A remote ref moved under a lift — lower, retry                     |
| `warehouse_locked`        | 6    | Another forklift process holds the warehouse lock                 |
| `out_of_scope`            | 7    | A path argument is outside a scoped (sparse) bay's scope          |
| `scope_path_type_changed` | 8    | A scoped bay's spine path flipped dir↔file; scope no longer valid |
| `sparse_workspace`        | 9    | A whole-tree verb is not supported in a scoped (sparse) bay yet   |
| `out_of_scope_conflict`   | 10   | A scoped bay merge hit an out-of-scope entry changed on both sides |
| `non_origin_lift`         | 11   | A sparse workspace tried to lift to a remote other than its origin |
| `narrow_unclean`          | 12   | `narrow` would delete a subtree that still holds uncommitted work  |
| `scope_prune_blocked`     | 13   | `scope-prune` would free a path a checkout still materializes       |
| `chunked_transport_unsupported` | 14   | A chunked large file can't go into a bundle, or is being lifted to a remote that doesn't support chunking |
| `oversized_transport_unsupported` | 15 | An object predates the size limit and can't be sent to a remote or bundle |
| `commit_pagination_unsupported` | 16 | A lift needs a paginated commit (many objects) and the remote doesn't support it yet |
| `empty_history`           | 19   | `history` was asked to walk a pallet that has nothing stacked on it yet            |

The codes and exit numbers are a contract: they get added to, never repurposed. A single
`match` in the head (over `forklift-core`'s `RefusalCode`) maps a refusal to its exit code, so a
new code cannot ship without an exit code wired to it. `empty_history` is the one exception to
that match — a head-only condition `forklift-core` never raises, classified directly in the head
(`crates/forklift/src/output.rs`) rather than through a `RefusalCode`. Exit codes 17 and 18 are
reserved for future features and are not yet assigned to any code.

A refusal a **remote** raises carries the same code: the server tags its JSON error body with the
stable `code` (see `format/REMOTE_PROTOCOL.md`), and the client classifies it with the same code
and exit code as a local one — so a script branches identically whether the refusal was local or
server-side.

## Structured conflicts

`forklift conflicts` lists the files an unresolved consolidation or cherry-pick left in conflict.
With `--json`, each file's three sides are **content addresses** — blob hashes a
resolver fetches (`forklift peek <hash>`) and diffs, instead of parsing marker soup:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "conflicts": [
      { "path": "f.txt", "markers": true,
        "base": "<hash>", "ours": "<hash>", "theirs": "<hash>" }
    ]
  }
}
```

A whole-file or binary conflict has `markers: false` and no sides. An empty list is a
valid answer — nothing to resolve — not an error.

## `forklift mcp` — the MCP server

`forklift mcp` runs a Model Context Protocol server on stdin/stdout (newline-delimited
JSON-RPC 2.0). Point an MCP client — an AI coding tool — at it, with the warehouse as
the working directory. It implements `initialize`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`.

Each tool re-invokes `forklift … --json` and returns its envelope, so the tools speak
the exact structured output above (and inherit the warehouse lock and exit-code
taxonomy). A command that exits non-zero comes back as an MCP tool error (`isError:
true`) carrying the error envelope — the agent sees the stable `code`/`next_step`, not
a crashed session.

The tool surface **mirrors the CLI** — every CLI command is exposed as a tool (a
multi-subcommand command becomes `<command>_<subcommand>` tools) or is on a small
human-only allow-list; a unit test (`every_cli_command_is_an_mcp_tool_or_explicitly_human_only`)
fails CI if that ever drifts. Tools (arguments in parentheses):

- **Inspect:** `stocktake` (summary?), `history` (revision?, class?, limit?, after?),
  `diff` (staged?, targets?), `peek` (object | inventory), `show` (target — a single
  "<revision>:<path>" string), `blame` (path, rev?), `audit` (pallet?), `conflicts`.
- **Change:** `load` (path), `remove` (path — stage a removal), `unload` (path — unstage),
  `stack` (description?), `restore` (path,
  staged?), `undo`, `park` / `park_list` / `park_pop`, `cherry_pick` (revision, message?),
  `deliver` (target, message?).
- **Maintain:** `compact` (all?) — pack the loose object store into a few dense pack files
  (safe to run anytime; worth running after a large import). `all=true` is a full repack:
  also rewrite existing packs, dropping unreachable garbage and consolidating.
- **Branch / merge:** `shift` (pallet), `consolidate` (pallet), `palletize` (name?,
  revision?, all?).
- **Remote:** `lift`, `lower`.
- **Review & metadata:** `manifest_note` / `manifest_approve` / `manifest_provenance`
  (model, transcript?, message?) / `manifest_show`, `haul_open` / `haul_list` / `haul_show` /
  `haul_comment` / `haul_review` / `haul_merge` / `haul_close` / `haul_reopen`,
  `tag_create` / `tag_show` / `tag_list`, `office_list`.
- **Sandboxing:** `bay_add` (name, path?, scope?), `bay_list`, `bay_remove`
  (name), `scope` — an orchestrator agent opens task-scoped (optionally sparse) sandboxes for
  its sub-agents directly. The scope a bay records is advisory local setup, not the agent's
  own security boundary; enforcement of what an identity may touch lives remote-side, on the
  server.

**Pagination:** `history` reads in pages — pass `limit`, and the result's `data.next`
cursor back as `after` for the following page (absent once exhausted). This is the
agent-facing counterpart of the CLI's pager (agents get a cursor, never a pager).

**Provenance is transport-derived, not self-reported.** For `manifest_provenance`
the server sets the `tool` from the connection's `clientInfo` (the harness that drove the
model) and mints the `session` itself — overriding anything the agent passes, so a model
cannot fabricate its own `tool`/`session` in the tool-call arguments. That is why those two
fields are **not** in the tool's schema. `model` stays the agent's attestation: MCP carries
no model identity, so nothing at the transport can supply or verify it. As always the entry
is *signed*, so who recorded it is forge-proof; the transport-derivation just removes the
model's own output from the `tool`/`session` it can't be trusted to report about itself.

**Not exposed** (deliberately human-only): warehouse/identity setup (`prepare`, `config`,
`profile`, `franchise`, `import-git`, `export-git`), the host-machine concerns `alias` and
`self-update`, and meta (`mcp`, `help`, `version`). `config` in particular can rewrite
`remote.url` / `remote.token`, which is not an agent-workflow action; the `office`
*mutations* (enrol/admit/rotate/…) are likewise held back — an agent operates within a
warehouse whose trust is already set up. (`office_list` is exposed, read-only.)

`bay` **is** exposed, despite also being a host working directory: an
orchestrator agent creating task-scoped sandboxes for sub-agents over MCP is how it uses
`bay`. Every bay operation is non-destructive — `bay_add` refuses onto a non-empty directory,
`bay_remove` only deletes forklift's own bookkeeping, never the materialized files.

Example session:

```
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05"}}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{"tools":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"forklift","version":"…"}}}
→ {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"stocktake","arguments":{"summary":true}}}
← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{…forklift envelope…}"}],"isError":false}}
```

## Notes for implementers

* Nothing but the envelope (or the MCP protocol messages) reaches stdout under
  `--json` / `mcp`. Progress chatter is suppressed; the result is a single document.
* Human output is untouched by all of this — the same commands print prose without
  `--json`, byte-for-byte as before.
