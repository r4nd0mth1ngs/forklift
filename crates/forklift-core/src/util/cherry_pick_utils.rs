//! Cherry-pick (§9.1 #8): apply one parcel's diff onto the current pallet as a new,
//! author-preserving, freshly-signed parcel.
//!
//! Cherry-pick is the sharpest gap left by declining rebase (§9.6), and it fits the
//! philosophy because it only *adds*: no rewrite, no force-push, nothing an audit has to
//! bless twice. The source parcel's change (the diff against its first parent) is three-way
//! merged onto the current head — exactly the merge machinery consolidate uses — and the
//! result is stacked as a **single-parent** parcel that preserves the source's authors and
//! records the picker as the stacker (the same Author/Stack split as import/export-git and
//! deliver). A clean pick is stacked immediately; a conflicting one leaves markers and a
//! cherry-pick state, and the next `stack` completes it — still single-parent, still
//! author-preserving.
//!
//! The state lives in the bay (a pick in progress belongs to the bay resolving it),
//! mutually exclusive with a consolidation.
