# Loose object format
This format is used to store objects in the objects store.
Objects are compressed using `zstd`.
The object consists of a header and the contents of the object.

## Header structure
Below is the structure of the loose object header (as of version `V2024_09_04`).
Each `[...]` represents a byte or a sequence of bytes.
```
[object_format_version_vlq][object_type_vlq][object_size_vlq][NULL]
```
Where:
- `object_format_version_vlq` is the code of the object format version, stored as a variable-length quantity.
See the list of version codes [here](../codes/LOOSE_OBJECT_FORMAT_VERSION_CODES.md).
- `object_type_vlq` is the code of the object type, stored as a variable-length quantity. See the list of object type
codes [here](../codes/OBJECT_TYPE_CODES.md).
- `object_size_vlq` is the size of the object (in bytes), stored as a variable-length quantity.
The header itself is not included in the size, so this is the size of the object contents.
- `NULL` is a null (zero) byte. It is used to separate the header from the contents.

Following bytes are the contents of the object. Documentation about the format of individual
object types can be found in the [format](.) directory.
