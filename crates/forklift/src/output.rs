//! The machine-facing output layer (DESIGN.html §7.4): a process-wide `--json` mode,
//! a versioned envelope, and the stable error/exit-code taxonomy (§7.8).
//!
//! Every command emits its result through one of the helpers here, so an agent parses
//! a single shape regardless of the command, and a human reads prose. The rules:
//!
//! * A command with real structured data implements [`CommandOutput`] and calls
//!   [`emit`] — human mode renders prose, JSON mode wraps the data in the envelope.
//! * A command whose result is just a sentence calls [`message`].
//! * Progress lines (silent under `--json`, they are not part of the result) use the
//!   [`human!`](crate::human) macro.
//!
//! Nothing else prints to stdout. That is what keeps `--json` output a single valid
//! JSON document.
