//! Cryptographic blame (§9.4a): attribute every line of a file to the parcel that
//! introduced it.
//!
//! An ordinary blame answers "who last touched this line". Forklift's answers more,
//! because authorship is signed and carries an identity class, a supervisor and
//! provenance (§7.1): the caller can turn the per-line parcel this module resolves into
//! "was this line written by a human or an agent, under whose supervision" — offline and
//! forge-proof, blame git structurally cannot express. This module does the history walk;
//! the head resolves the parcel it returns to that signed metadata (core never prints).
//!
//! The walk follows the **first-parent chain** from the revision back to the root, exactly
//! git's `blame --first-parent`. Each parcel where the file's blob changed is a *version*;
//! successive versions are matched line by line with the same LCS the merge uses, so a line
//! unchanged from the previous version keeps its older attribution and a genuinely new line
//! is attributed to the version that introduced it. Lines a merge parcel brought in from a
//! side line (its second parent) are attributed to the merge — the honest limit of a
//! first-parent walk, and the natural reading of "where did this line enter this pallet".
