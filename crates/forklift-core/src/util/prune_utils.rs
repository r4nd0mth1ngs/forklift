//! Scope-prune: reclaiming a sparse warehouse's disk by freeing the content under a
//! narrowed-away fetch-scope path (DESIGN.html §7.6).
//!
//! Distinct from reachability-`gc` on purpose. The objects a prune frees are still reachable
//! from pallet heads — ordinary history, not garbage — so `gc` neither does nor structurally
//! can free them. A prune frees them precisely because the warehouse fetch scope no longer
//! covers their path: afterward each is sealed by the hash its parent spine tree still commits,
//! exactly the state of an object a sparse franchise never fetched. So a prune re-enters the
//! "sealed but unfetched" state rather than leaving a hole an absence check would flag.
//!
//! The reclamation is computed as the closure of the pruned subtree(s) across history, minus
//! everything the post-prune scope still keeps. The subtraction makes it content-addressing-
//! safe: an object the pruned path shares with a still-fetched path (or with any meta pallet)
//! is retained, never freed. Meta pallets (office and the rest) are walked in full and never
//! scoped — the carve-out this feature depends on.
//!
//! Callers hold the warehouse lock and narrow the fetch scope *before* deleting (durable
//! before destructive): once the scope is narrowed, every scope-aware walk reads the pruned
//! path as out-of-scope, so no deletion can ever leave an object that reads as unexpectedly
//! *missing*. A crash mid-deletion therefore leaves the store correct — the deleted objects
//! read as sealed-but-unfetched, and any not-yet-deleted objects are harmless present-but-out-
//! of-scope extras (still reachable history, so `gc` keeps them; a scope-aware repack is the
//! future path that would reclaim them). The reverse order would be unsafe: deleting before
//! narrowing could leave an in-scope object missing, the one state absence must never mean.
//!
//! A crashed or killed prune must also be **resumable**, not just safe: a later call for the
//! same path re-derives the closure and finishes freeing what an earlier run left behind. That
//! requires the target closure to tolerate a partially-deleted plan — a hash absent mid-walk
//! must mean "already freed by an earlier run," never "corrupt, stop" — which only holds if
//! objects are always freed in an order where **every child is deleted before its parent**
//! ([`collect_prune_targets`] computes exactly that order, and `free_objects` deletes a plan
//! front-to-back). Under that discipline, a present parent implies every one of its still-listed
//! children is present too, so an absent node can only mean its whole subtree was already
//! freed — never a corrupt gap a resumed walk could misinterpret as newly-discovered garbage.
