//! The core error type (DESIGN.html §7.4 error taxonomy) and its stable refusal codes.
//!
//! `forklift-core` never prints and cannot depend on a head's presentation types, yet some of
//! its failures are **classified refusals** an agent must be able to branch on — a path outside a
//! scoped bay, a chunked file that cannot ride a bundle, a lift to the wrong remote. [`CoreError`]
//! is where that classification lives: a [`CoreError::Refusal`] carries a typed [`RefusalCode`]
//! (one of the stable codes below) plus the human message and the machine-actionable next step; a
//! [`CoreError::Other`] is everything not yet classified — a plain error with no code.
//!
//! ## The migration frontier
//!
//! Historically a refusal travelled from core to the CLI as a **sentinel-framed string** (a
//! `\u{1f}`-delimited frame the CLI decoded at its error boundary), because there was no shared
//! error type. [`CoreError`] is that type. The refusal *constructors* (in
//! [`scope_utils`](crate::util::scope_utils) and [`bundle_utils`](crate::util::bundle_utils)) now
//! return a typed `CoreError::Refusal` — the sentinel string is no longer the source of truth.
//!
//! It is not gone from every path, though. Migrating a function to `Result<_, CoreError>` is
//! cheap where it *produces* a refusal directly (the command entry points, the remote/bundle
//! guards); it is expensive across the deep tree/merge/shift walkers, which return
//! `Result<_, String>` and would each need every one of their many `Err` sites rewritten. Those
//! deep walkers stay String-typed for now. To let a typed refusal cross such a still-String
//! segment losslessly, the sentinel framing survives as a **bridge shim**, invoked only by the
//! two `From` conversions here:
//!
//! * [`From<CoreError> for String`](#impl-From<CoreError>-for-String) re-frames a `Refusal` into
//!   the sentinel encoding when a typed error is `?`-propagated (or `.into()`-converted) into a
//!   `Result<_, String>` caller, and
//! * [`From<String> for CoreError`](#impl-From<String>-for-CoreError) decodes that frame back into
//!   a typed `Refusal` when the String re-enters a `CoreError`-typed caller (and reads any plain
//!   string as `Other`).
//!
//! Because both directions round-trip, `?` works seamlessly across the frontier and the code is
//! never lost — a refusal born typed, framed to cross a String walker, and re-lifted at the
//! command boundary classifies exactly as one that stayed typed throughout. On the fully-typed
//! paths (a refusal produced and consumed without ever touching a `Result<_, String>` segment) the
//! string encoding is never invoked at all. The head decodes the *type*, not the string:
//! `forklift`'s `From<CoreError> for ForkliftError` matches [`RefusalCode`] exhaustively, so adding
//! a code without wiring its exit code is a compile error.

/// The framing that marks a refusal string so a String-typed segment can carry it losslessly and

/// strips control characters (including `\u{1f}`) from the message and next step at construction,
/// and `WarehousePath::from_user_input` rejects control characters in a user-supplied path at
/// input validation. That sanitization is what keeps the framing unambiguous; a plain error that
/// still happens to contain a stray `\u{1f}` (built by hand, bypassing those guards) simply fails
/// to `strip_prefix` and degrades to [`CoreError::Other`] rather than misparsing. This is the

///
/// This is the mechanism that makes the taxonomy's completeness a compile-time or deterministic-
/// test property rather than a hopeful comment. Before this macro, the enum, its `as_str` match
/// and a hand-written `ALL_CODES` array were three separate lists a contributor had to update in
/// lockstep by discipline alone; `as_str`'s match was compiler-enforced exhaustive (the compiler
/// catches a forgotten `as_str` arm), but nothing forced `ALL_CODES` to keep up — a variant added
/// to the enum and to `as_str` but left out of `ALL_CODES` compiled cleanly, and
/// `RefusalCode::from_code` (which searches `ALL_CODES`) would then silently never recognize that
/// code's string. Worse, the round-trip test iterated `ALL_CODES` too, so it passed — vacuously,
/// proving nothing about the variant it never saw. The forgotten variant's code would still
/// *display* correctly locally, but the moment it crossed a still-`String` migration-frontier
/// segment (see the module docs), `CoreError::from(String)` would fail to recognize the reframed
/// code and silently degrade it to `Other` — exactly the classification loss this taxonomy exists
/// to prevent, and exactly the kind of regression a green test suite would not catch.
///
/// With the enum, `as_str` and `ALL_CODES` generated from one macro invocation, there is no second
/// list to forget: a variant that does not appear in the invocation below does not exist at all
/// (not in the enum, so every other `match` on `RefusalCode` still forces it in), and a variant
/// that does appear is in `ALL_CODES` by construction. The set is still **add-only**: introduce a
