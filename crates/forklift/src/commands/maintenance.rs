/// consolidate accumulated packs, so the store stays healthy without the user remembering to
/// `compact`. Opt out with `maintenance.auto = false`.

/// It runs **synchronously, under the caller's warehouse lock** (call it right after a
/// mutating command's work, before the lock is released). Synchronous on purpose: the
/// warehouse lock is exclusive and fail-fast, so a detached background compaction holding it
/// would break the user's next command — running here, under the lock we already hold, keeps
/// it correct and race-free. It is threshold-gated so it fires rarely, and best-effort, so a
/// failure never fails the command that just succeeded.
