//! Deliver a draft pallet's checkpoint trail as one clean signed parcel (§7.3).
//!
//! Agents checkpoint constantly; humans want one reviewed parcel. `deliver` squashes the
//! draft pallet's net change into a single signed parcel on the target — a plain
//! single-parent parcel carrying the draft head's tree, so the checkpoints stay *out* of
//! the target's history — and records the trail as a signed **delivery** manifest entry
//! referencing the kept checkpoints. The clean story stays clean; the "what the agent
//! tried, in what order" evidence stays complete and discoverable.
//!
//! Because the delivered tree equals the draft head's tree, the working directory does not
//! change: delivering only moves refs, never materializes.
